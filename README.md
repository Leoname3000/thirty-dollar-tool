## Change instruments in a .ðŸ—¿ file for your Thirty Dollar Website song!
1. Input path to your .ðŸ—¿ file
2. Enter name of the instrument you want to change ("Old item")
3. Enter name of the desired instrument you want to replace the old one with ("New item")
4. Enter difference in pitches between the instruments to keep the original tone 
(identify by ear, maybe I'll add an automatic tone conversion mechanism in the future ;p)
5. And boom! You have changed the instrument/pitch of your song much faster than you would have done by hand!

(to change only the pitch of an instrument, enter the same instrument in both the "Old item" and the "New item", I hope to implement a separate function for that later)

- You can find names for the instruments by opening your .ðŸ—¿ file with a text editor. (They look like "noteblock_bass", "stopposting", "amogus", etc.)
- I recommend to duplicate your song before changing anything, so that you don't lose your progress if something goes wrong!
